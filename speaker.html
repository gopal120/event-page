        <h3>Aaron Irizarry</h3>
        <h4>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h4>
        <p>
          Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a
          beer fridge, and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or big
          corporations. It’s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the
          motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s what stifles a
          workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel
          valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows
          it to succeed. In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the
          traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He
          will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that
          others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own
          workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a culture of design
          it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.

        <h4>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM FILMMAKERS</h4>
        <p>
          Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a
          combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling
          technique. It’s the filmmaker’s job to put this together. To do so
          they’ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to
          focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the
          many elements that together comprise a well-told story. With this
          workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and
          expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We’ll
          look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat
          sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider why they’re used and how we
          might look to them for inspiration.

        <h4>(YOU SHOULD BE) TESTING YOUR JAVASCRIPT</h4>
        <p>
          JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested libraries
          like jQuery, AngularJS, Backbone.js and more, but how can we be sure
          that our code is ready for production? This talk will share tips on
          how writing tests can be written easily and quickly and how to remove
          buggy code through testing.

        <h4>DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</h4>
        <p>
          Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process. Prototyping
          makes things a little better by allowing you to stitch together static
          wireframes or mockups while adding basic interactions. Rapid
          prototyping with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is even better and faster;
          it increases collaboration and improves the iteration process. Kill
          your wireframes. Long live rapid prototyping.
